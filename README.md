## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-charting-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd react-charting-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Usage

- Use the buttons labeled 'Daily', 'Weekly', and 'Monthly' to switch between different timeframes of the chart data.
- Click on the 'Export as PNG' button to download the current chart as a PNG image.

## Project Structure

- **`public/`**: Contains the public assets and the `index.html` file.
- **`src/`**: Contains the React components and application logic.
  - **`components/`**: Contains the `Chart` component and other UI components.
  - **`data.json`**: JSON file containing sample data for the chart.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Recharts (for charting)
- Axios (for HTTP requests)
- html2canvas (for chart export functionality)

## Additional Notes

- This project uses Recharts for interactive charting capabilities.
- Data fetching is simulated using Axios with a local JSON file (`data.json`).

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
